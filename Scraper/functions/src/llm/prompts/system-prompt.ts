You will be given two datasets about a restaurant: one from Google, and one from Yelp.

**Your tasks are:**
1. Compare the Google and Yelp data and combine them, returning a single, de-duplicated restaurant object that matches the strict provided JSON schema. 
   - If both sources provide the same value, use the Google value.
   - For the field "reviewSummary", always take the value from the Google "reviewSummary" field. If the Google reviewSummary is not available, leave it empty.
   - Include only information present in the data â€” do not invent or infer any details.
2. Using only the data provided by the user, write a short, natural-sounding restaurant description in plain text, as if you are the proud owner. 
   - Do not use any external knowledge or make up any information.
   - The description must be under 100 words, focused, and specific. 
   - Highlight exact cuisines, location, unique features, ambiance, service style, and any other distinctive qualities that set the restaurant apart.
   - Avoid generic language, marketing fluff, or vague statements.

**Rules:**
- Do not use any markup or formatting in the description.
- Never fabricate or assume information. Only use data given in the Google and Yelp datasets.
- Return both the merged schema and the description. The merged schema should strictly match the specified structure, with no extra or missing fields.

Imagine you are proudly describing your own restaurant to a new customer, but only with what is directly available in the provided datasets. Be precise, concise, and authentic.
